# Diagnostic Report: Alchemy Lab v4.0 vs. Agricola

## 1. Mechanical Fidelity (Structurally Sound but Divergent)

| Feature | Agricola Model | Alchemy Lab v4.0 | Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Action Reveal** | New action card revealed every round. | Static board (Upgrades purchased manually). | **MISSING**: Lacks progressive expansion tension. |
| **Action Resolution** | Immediate. | Deferred (Production Phase). | **DIVERGENT**: Lose tactical tension of immediate gains. |
| **Feeding** | Predictable scarcity (2 Food/worker). | Stochastic Disaster Phase (Random damage). | **MISMATCH**: v4.0 feels like "disaster management," not "subsistence survival." |
| **Growth** | Family members grow via new rooms. | Fixed 2 workers + 1 potential Apprentice. | **FAITHFUL**: But fixed cap limits late-game scaling. |
| **Pacing** | 14 Rounds / 6 Stages. | 10 Rounds / No Stages. | **DIVERGENT**: Curve is flatter; lacks "Harvest" milestones. |

## 2. Emotional Arc (Ambition vs. Anxiety)
- **Scarcity Pressure**: v4.0 health maintenance is interesting but lacks the "Food calculation" anxiety of Agricola.
- **Blocking Tension**: Visible, but the lack of immediate resolution makes blocking feel less urgent (you aren't blocking someone from getting wood they need *right now* to build a room).
- **Spatial Satisfaction**: Legible, but the lab grid feels like a "buff wall" rather than a developing "environment."

## 3. Interface & Visual Clarity
- **Pros**: Clear counters, Narrator guidance, Emoji placeholders.
- **Gaps**:
    - **Centralized Action Board**: Currently mixed with personal lab board.
    - **Tabletop Aesthetic**: Needs distinct "Card" vs "Tile" visual separation.
    - **Phase Color Coding**: UI is functional but visually uniform.

## 4. Recommendations for v5.0 ("The Alchemist's Harvest")

### Structural Changes
1. **Immediate Resolution**: Change from "Production Phase" to workers producing resources the moment they are placed.
2. **The Hazard Ladder -> The Quota**: Replace stochastic disasters with a predictable **"Audit/Maintenance" (Harvest)** every few rounds requiring 2 "Vials" (Food) per worker.
3. **Round Cards**: Start with 4 basic actions; reveal 1 "Advanced Action" card (outline-style) every round.

### Interface Changes
1. **The Board Split**: A central shared "Market/Action Cards" area and a separate "Personal Lab" grid.
2. **Visual Style**: Use CSS border-image or heavy double-borders to create a "Tabletop" feel.
3. **Phase Icons**: Animated icons for "Work Phase" vs "Harvest Phase."

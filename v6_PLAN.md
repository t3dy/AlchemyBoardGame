# Design Plan: Alchemy Lab v6.0 "The Merchant of Secrets"

## 1. Puerto Rico Influence: "The Follow"
In our current versions, you place workers and the rival is a passive "disaster" or "timer." In v6.0, we introduce the **Role Selection** mechanic.

| Puerto Rico Role | Alchemical Adaptation | Privilege (for the Selector) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architect** | **Guild Master** | Build buildings at -1 Gold. |
| **Producer** | **Head Alchemist** | +1 Product from your choice of building. |
| **Trader** | **Court Agent** | Sell goods at +1 Gold value. |
| **Captain** | **Patron** | Ship goods for +1 bonus VP. |
| **Builder** | **Artisan** | Everyone produces, but builder gets to "Sublime" for free. |

## 2. Historical Products (Laboratories of Art)
We shift from "Potions" to the specific chemical industries of the 17th Century.

### **Artistic Pigments**
- **Vermilion**: Requires Mercury & Sulfur (Sublimation).
- **Ultramarine**: Requires Lapis Lazuli & Wax (Separation).
- **Lead White**: Requires Lead & Vinegar (Corrosion).

### **Chemical Specializations**
- **Aqua Regia**: The universal solvent for dissolving Gold.
- **Spirit of Salt**: (Hydrochloric Acid) for metal preparation.
- **Venetian Glass**: Specialized soda-ash and silica recipes.

### **Medicinal Spagyrics**
- **Antimony Pill**: Requires Stibnite & Saltpeter.
- **Aqua Vitae**: Concentrated distilled alcohol from wine.

## 3. The New Gameplay Loop
1. **Council Phase**: Player picks a role card.
2. **Follow Phase**: 
   - Player performs the role action (with bonus).
   - Rival AI performs a simplified version.
3. **Ship Phase**: Once per round, products are shipped to the "Princes of Europe" for VPs.
4. **Maintenance**: Still requires some support, but the focus shifts to **Export Wealth**.

## 4. Visual Identity
- The screen will feature **Large Action Cards** (like in Puerto Rico).
- The laboratory will be divided into "Ateliers" (Workshops).
- Icons for 🎨 (Artists), ⚕️ (Apothecaries), and 🏰 (Courts).

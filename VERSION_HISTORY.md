# 📜 Version History: The Alchemy Lab Evolution

This document tracks the iterative design journey of the Alchemy Lab, showing how each version refined the mechanics to better realize the vision of a "tactical, high-pressure laboratory simulator."

---

## 🧪 Version 1.0: The Mobile Prototype
**Goal**: Test basic interaction and resource loops.
- **What we tried**: A single-column mobile interface where actions were "cards" drawn from a deck.
- **Realization of Vision**: Established the core theme of balancing productivity vs. risk. 
- **The Lesson**: The game lacked "place"—it was just a numbers engine. We needed a laboratory to manage.

## 🔥 Version 2.0: The Furnace and the Stone
**Goal**: Introduce spatial management and worker assignment.
- **What we tried**: A 3x3 lab grid where players purchased furniture (tiles) and placed workers.
- **Realization of Vision**: Added "Laboratory Management" as a core pillar. Introduced the balance between Reputation (VP) and Suspicion (Loss).
- **The Lesson**: Random hazards felt too unpredictable. Without a round structure, it felt like a clicker game rather than a board game.

## 📖 Version 3.0: The Board Game Engine
**Goal**: Formalize rules and provide explicit player guidance.
- **What we tried**: A rigid 5-phase round structure (Agricola-style) and the **Narrator System**—onscreen guidance to explain available moves.
- **Realization of Vision**: The game became a "Board Game Engine." Health states (Green to Black) introduced bodily fragility as a resource.
- **The Lesson**: While structured, it lacked a "crescendo." It was a survival game that didn't yet escalate in pressure.

## 🌪️ Version 4.0: Hazard Escalation
**Goal**: Implement high-stakes tactical depth and predictable pressure curves.
- **What we tried**: Role Drafting, Tiered Hazards, and the 10-Round Pressure Curve.
- **Realization of Vision**: Shifted focus to tactical preparation and mitigation.

## 🧺 Version 5.0: The Alchemist's Harvest (Current)
**Goal**: Achieve mechanical fidelity with the Agricola loop.
- **What we tried**: 
    - **14-Round Stage Structure**: Card reveal every round.
    - **Immediate Action Resolution**: Placing a worker provides resources instantly.
    - **The Harvest (Autumn Audit)**: Predictable maintenance/feeding cost (Reagents).
    - **Family Growth**: Build rooms to hire more alchemists.
- **Realization of Vision**: This is the most "Agricola-like" version. It replaces random disasters with the crushing anxiety of subsistence. The laboratory now feels like a developing home that must be sustained.

## ⚖️ Version 6.0: The Merchant of Secrets (Current)
**Goal**: Incorporate Puerto Rico's "Select & Follow" roles and 17th-century chemical industries.
- **What we tried**: 
    - **Role Action System**: Picking a role (Guild Master, Merchant) triggers actions for everyone.
    - **Historical Product Chains**: Creating Vermilion, Antimony pills, and Spirits of Salt.
    - **The Rival AI**: A competing alchemist who follows your role selections.
- **Realization of Vision**: Shifts the alchemist from a subsistence farmer to a specialized industry professional. The game is no longer just about survival, but about dominating the market for secret artistic and medicinal goods.
